I've just finished college, and I'm moving back to San Francisco
in May to start working with [Scribd](http://scribd.com).

Last summer I interned with Mozilla's [Release Engineering]()
team in SF working on [Runner](http://github.com/mozilla/build-runner).
Before that, I interned back home in Ireland with a [big energy company](http://esbi.ie)
and an [enterprise field-management SaaS company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fieldaware).

I studied CS at Trinity College, Dublin and I used to be chair of the
[Dublin University Computer Science Society](http://ducss.ie).

I like to teach and I've given introductory workshops on
[Python](http://connolly.io/slides/python101) and
[Flask](http://connolly.io/slides/flask101) to fellow students. Check out the
other talks I've given [here](http://connolly.io/talks).

I'm interested in functional programming, distributed systems,
and Cool Web Thingsâ„¢. I generally stick of all my hacky projects
related to these things up on [Github](http://github.com/IanConnolly) mainly
as a warning to anyone who might want to hire me.

I [tweet a lot](http://twitter.com/IanConnolly).

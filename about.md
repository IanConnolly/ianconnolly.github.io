I'm a CS student at Trinity College, Dublin.

I've interned for a big non-tech company, a rapidly growing tech company, and
helped build a [mobile games platform](http://github.com/tcd-tophat)
with my mates. I used to be chair of the
[Dublin University Computer Science Society](http://ducss.ie).

I'm a big fan of the Dublin tech scene and I help organise events like
[this](http://ducss.ie/summit). I sometimes freelance for startups, mainly
on back-end stuff.

I like to teach and I've given introductory workshops on
[Python](http://connolly.io/slides/python101) and
[Flask](http://connolly.io/slides/flask101) to fellow students. All talks I
give are hosted [here](http://connolly.io/talks).

I like craft beer, good food, the open web and open-source. All of my F/OSS
code is available on [Github](http://github.com/IanConnolly).

This site is built
with Jekyll using a hacked version of the
[Lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) theme, and hosted
on Github Pages (thanks guys &lt;3). The repository lives
[here](http://github.com/IanConnolly/ianconnolly.github.io).

Technically, I'm interested in functional programming, distributed systems,
and Cool Web Thingsâ„¢.

My [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/mrnsno) is a source of constant
embarrassment to my friends.

I [tweet a lot](http://twitter.com/IanConnolly).

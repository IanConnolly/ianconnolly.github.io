I'm a software engineer working at [Scribd](http://scribd.com)
working on backend-y things in Ruby/Rails.

Before I graduated, I interned with Mozilla's
[Release Engineering](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering)
team in SF working on [Runner](http://github.com/mozilla/build-runner).
Prior to that, I interned back home in Ireland with a [big energy company](http://esbi.ie)
and an [enterprise field-management SaaS company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fieldaware).

I studied CS at Trinity College, Dublin and I used to be chairperson of the
[Dublin University Computer Science Society](http://ducss.ie).

I live in San Francisco, California with my fianc√©e Lara and our two cats, Seamus &amp;
Heathcliff.

_note from adult-ish ian:_ I've had a personal site online in some capacity for
nearly 4 years now.  A lot has happened in that time, and I've grown up,
at least somewhat (I have a beard now!).

Much of the content here seems like it was written by a different person and
I don't think it accurately reflects who I am now. I thought about deleting 
it all and starting from scratch a couple of times, but eventually decided 
against it. I don't particularly like or relate to the me who wrote these,
but I do think the posts reflect who I was when they were written.

For better or worse I think having a public reminder of who I was before
is a solid check against my/future-me's head from inflating too much again.

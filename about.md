I'm a third year CS student at Trinity College, Dublin, Chairperson at the
[Dublin University Computer Science Society](http://ducss.ie) and a freelance
back-end developer.

I've interned for a big non-tech company, a smaller tech company, freelanced for
start-ups and helped build a [mobile games platform](http://github.com/tcd-tophat)
with my mates.

I'm a big fan of the Dublin start-up/tech scene and I help organise events like
[this](http://ducss.ie/summit).

I like to teach and I've given introductory workshops on
[Python](http://connolly.io/slides/python101) and
[Flask](http://connolly.io/slides/flask101) to fellow students.

I like craft beer, good food, the open web and open-source.
I apparently don't like my bank balance.

I [tweet a lot](http://twitter.com/IanConnolly).

I'm a software engineer working at [Scribd](http://scribd.com)
working on backend-y things in Ruby/Rails.

Before I graduated, I interned with Mozilla's
[Release Engineering](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering)
team in SF working on [Runner](http://github.com/mozilla/build-runner).
Prior to that, I interned back home in Ireland with a [big energy company](http://esbi.ie)
and an [enterprise field-management SaaS company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fieldaware).

I studied CS at Trinity College, Dublin and I used to be chairperson of the
[Dublin University Computer Science Society](http://ducss.ie).

I live in San Francisco, California with my fianc√©e Lara and our two cats, Seamus &amp;
Heathcliff.

_note from adult-ish ian:_ I've had a personal site online in some capacity for nearly 4 years now.
A lot has happened in that time, and I've grown up, at least partially.  Much of the content here
seems like it was written by a different person. I thought about deleting it all and starting from
scratch a couple of times, but decided against it. I don't think the words written here
accurately reflect me now, however I think they did reflect me when they were written. For better
or worse I think having a public reminder of that is a solid check against my/future-me's head
from inflating too much again.

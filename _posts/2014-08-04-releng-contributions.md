When myself and the other Release Engineering interns started, we were pretty
overwhelmed by the amount of stuff we had to know and to do in order to be
productive. Our manager, [Laura](http://www.laurathomson.com/),
noticed this and asked us to figure out how the team could improve.

We felt that the problems we were having were symptoms of the same problem
that has led to Mozilla Releng having historically low numbers of outside
contributors compared with other Mozilla teams. We thought that treating new
hires like new contributors would be a great way for us to kill two birds with
one stone, while increasing transparency and making other Mozillians
more aware of what we do.

We've been making great progress over the last couple of weeks, so here's some
highlights.

* Possibly the biggest public facing change: I've written a new [Contributor's
Guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Contribute) which should go
some way into giving new contributors more actionable direction and help
them feel more at ease.

* I've added Release Engineering to Josh Matthews's excellent
[What Can I Do For Mozilla?](http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/proglang/py/releng-py)

* [Anhad](http://ffledgling.com/) put a huge amount of work into marking
outstanding bugs in
[Funsize](https://github.com/mozilla/build-funsize) as Good First/Mentored Bugs.

* [John](http://johnzeller.com/blog/category/mozilla/) shipped
[Tupperware](http://johnzeller.com/blog/2014/06/18/tupperware-mozilla-apps-in-docker/)
which is an awesome step in the right direction for getting Releng
development environments on new contributor's machines painlessly.

* I pulled what I learned about [Dustin's](http://code.v.igoro.us/) new
[RelengAPI](https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengapi) into a handy
[template](https://github.com/IanConnolly/build-relengapi-template) for new
applications.

These changes have already had a great impact. We've had 2 new contributors
reach out in the past two weeks, with one patch about to land in Funsize. We've
got a ways to go, especially in improving documentation and our selection of
mentored bugs, but it's been great to get such immediate positive feedback.

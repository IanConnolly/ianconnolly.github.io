[Papers We Love](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love) is a meetup group for
programmers who still love keeping in touch with academic research. There are
regular meetup groups in NYC, SF, London, St. Louis and Boulder.

I think that with the explosive growth in Dublin's tech scene that it'd be
good to provide a group where engineers who are interested in keeping up with
awesome current research from around the world can do so in a relaxed space.
It'd also help to bridge the gap between the academic CS community in Dublin
and the growing tech/startup scene, and I think that sort of cross-pollination
can only be good for both communities.

I've only recently discovered PWL, but I'd love to help a Dublin one get off the
ground. Unfortunately I'm heading to SF for the summer so it'd be a while
before I could be properly involved in setting something up, but I'm more than
happy to just help connect interested people and try and get a core group
going for the moment.

What do people think? Shoot me a mail at ```ian@<this-url>``` if you'd be
interested in setting up something like a PWL Dublin, if you'd like to sponsor
it or if you just want to express your interest in attending.

So I finally got around to putting this up.

A wise man once said never to start a blog/podcast or anything of the sort until you've got a folder full of already completed editions ready to go out so that you'll have stuff to post as you struggle to get over the motivation problem in the first week or two.

Well I've got an ideas folder, a 6-pack of beer and no filter. How's that for wise?

title: Exploitative Internships in Dublin
description: Exploitative Internships in Dublin
category: posts

It's internship season and every CS undergrad is scrambling to find work. I've
just see one of my friends just got a fairly derisory offer. To be honest,
derisory doesn't cut it. It was downright exploitative. Less than half
the minimum wage. The excuse: "We're an early stage start-up and this is all we
can afford".

Let's just get something straight: Employing someone and not paying
them a fair wage is exploitative. There isn't a single situation where it is
acceptable to pay someone less than minimum wage for work. Not for 'training',
not for their 'portfolio', and **not** for 'experience'.

And it most definitely **is** employment by the way, don't attempt to spin
this by saying 'internships are for training'. If someone is shipping production
code for you then they are a fixed-term employee and should be compensated
as such.

This practice is particularly endemic in the nascent Dublin startup scene, where
new companies feel [employment laws](http://www.ictu.ie/internrights/)
(or just morals in general) don't apply to them. All that matters to them,
and their investors, is growth -  and it doesn't matter who they exploit along
the way. They sell the myth of 'experience', so they can get a student to build
their MVP for free. Dublin startups are exploiting the fear that students have
of not finding employment at graduation for their own gain.

I'm incredibly disappointed in companies that engage in this behaviour. They
talk about _changing the world_ (barf) when all they are doing is undermining
centuries of effort in the labour movement and taking advantage of vulnerable,
cash-strapped students to help build their dream and fortune. I'm also
incredibly disappointed in the incubators, accelerators, investors, and
Enterprise Ireland who tolerate, profit from, and implicitly encourage this
behaviour by not banning it. The fact that some of these companies are funded
partially with public money is just the icing on the cake.

People talk about the lack of skilled engineering graduates in Ireland.
Well, apologies for my language, but how the fuck do you expect people to gain
these skills if you're not going to pay them enough to make rent, let alone
feed themselves? Only a select, lucky few can work for 'experience' rather than
the more conventional 'money'.  Are we honestly going to turn the fledgling
tech industry in Ireland into another bastion of private school privilege?
Where's your beloved meritocracy now? Beneath the hoodies, the buddha bags, and
the free beer, Irish startups are becoming every bit as bad as the companies
that they scoff at. Perhaps worse - at least the rest don't pretend
to be 'cool'.

I've pinged the chairpeople of the [DUCSS](http://ducss.ie) and
[Netsoc](http://netsoc.ie) to strongly encourage them to create a public,
naming-and-shaming blacklist of Irish tech companies that take advantage of
students. Enough is enough. If you can't afford someone to work for you,
then don't attempt to hire someone. And if you do, we need to make it clear
that there will be very public consequences.

I know that these practices are not limited to tech, but it's what I have the
most experience in. Though my own experiences with internships in a semi-state
and with a great Irish tech company have been really positive, I've most
definitely been one of the lucky ones.

I know the [USI](http://usi.ie/president/job-bridge-broken/)
are campaigning against JobBridge, but I'd love to see a wider movement
against exploitation by private enterprises from both the USI and individual
student unions.

Oh and on a completely unrelated note, I have an incredibly talented iOS
developer friend looking for an internship - so holler at ```ian@connolly.io```
if you're hiring.
